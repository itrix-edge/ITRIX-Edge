ITRIX-Edge: Software Define Edge
================================

**[中文簡介](README_TW.md)**

ITRIX-Edge leverages containers and kubernetes to edge software can easily connect to major cloud providers.
The main focus of this project is to make deployment and maintanence easily.
With the build in connection to cloud provider, users can easily connnect the edge to cloud.


# Overview

Currently, this project covered two parts, one for physical hardware and other one for software stack. The hardware part includes compute node power control, hardware reset and hardware status report. The software stack is based on container technique, and use kubernetes as container orchestration backend. System services and user applications will run on top of kubernetes, provide appliance management tasks and cloud integration works.
